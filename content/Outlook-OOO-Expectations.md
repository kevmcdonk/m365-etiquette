Use Out of Office settings to manage expectations for responding to emails
- Do not leave Out of Office on all the time just because you are busy
- Always state the dates that the Out of Office applies to
- Provide alternative contacts where possible

## Meetings
- Use the scheduling assistant to check that internal invitees to your meetings have availability
- Use Findtime to poll invitees (both internal and external) for preferences
- Provide an agenda setting out expectations for preparation, running order of the meeting and expected follow up activities
